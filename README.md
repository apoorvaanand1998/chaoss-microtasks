My solutions to the [CHAOSS microtasks](https://github.com/chaoss/grimoirelab/issues/182) for GSoC Idea #3: Support of Source Code Related Metrics 

Here's a recap of all I've done in the microtasks:

- [Microtask 1](https://github.com/apoorvaanand1998/chaoss-microtasks/tree/feedback1/Microtask1) - Perceval has been set up to be executed from Pycharm, and the Grimoirelab toolkit as well. Project structure has been shown.
- [Microtask 2](https://github.com/apoorvaanand1998/chaoss-microtasks/tree/feedback1/Microtask2) - Git and GitHub backend of Perceval have been used along with their own argument parsers.
- [Microtask 3](https://github.com/apoorvaanand1998/chaoss-microtasks/tree/feedback1/Microtask3) - Answered the questions about the git commands used and why they're important. Explained the json attributes and also the command backend methods with a brief explanation. 
- [Microtask 4](https://github.com/apoorvaanand1998/chaoss-microtasks/tree/feedback1/Microtask4) - Written two scripts. One, giving us the date of last visit and the other exploring the SoftwareHeritage API.
